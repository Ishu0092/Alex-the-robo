## What it does ‚ùì
Alex Robo can recognize the various commands such as jokes, thoughts, opening youtube, discord, greeting,  you just need to speak a command to the bot they are also mentioned in the project. It fetches random jokes and thoughts for the user and opens quick things directly like discord, Gmail inbox, youtube, weather reports. there is a button to restart the bot if somehow it crashes and if the console got full of commands and replies. I'm working on some more features to add to the bot.

## How we built it
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Images and gifs with transform effects with the help of CSS. And Used javascript to fetch different APIs such as dictionary, jokes, and thoughts.

## What we learned
Fetch APIs and display the output in a proficient manner. Learned deep knowledge of Vanilla javascript functions and some transform animations in CSS.

## What's next for Alex Robo ü§ñ
I'm working on some more HTML pages which will gonna linked to this project with more info and one more mini-game. And trying to make it more user-friendly. And more productive functions to the bot
